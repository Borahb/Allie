# Allie
Allie is an AI chatbot which is built using NLP in Python. It is still in development. At this stage Allie is trained to give answers to specific questions. Its main goal is to be an interactive bot which can deal with small conversations. As such we all know human language is very complicated, so it would require a lot of time to achieve its full capacity.
